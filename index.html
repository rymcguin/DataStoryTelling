<p>
	Hello! I am Computer Science and Economics major at Lehigh University. I came into Lehigh as a January admit and have been working hard to graduate with the class of 2021.
	I am Software Developer and love to make clean and easy to follow UI. I'm interning at start up company while also doing projects on the side. A few of my projects include a personal resume page at <a href=https://ryanmcguiness.com>ryanmcguiness.com</a>. I have also created a website that provides book recomendations which could be seen at <a href="https://booksthatmakeyousmarter.com">booksthatmakeyousmarter.com</a>. It is an amazon associated website, so whenever people purchase a book, I recieve a percentage.
