# US Beer Consumption

- Author: Ryan McGuiness

The map below shows the consumption of beer across the United States. I was not directly looking for this data set, but it had very neat data that had a lot of useful variables. The operations that I mostly used in this representation was geo-location and sum. With these two functions I was able to put together this map that makes it easy to tell which states consume the most kegs and barrels. The pie chart on the bottom right is the representation of bottle and can consumption. Not much changed, however Colorado did take the lead away from California in bottle and can consumption. With this data alcoholic beverage companies can better focus their advertisements to capture more of the market at a lower cost, by focusing their adds by location.

# #BLM Visualization

This grah provides a visualization of the black lives matter hashtag across the United States. As you can tell from the graph this righteous movement has swept the nation. The heat map shows that this movment has gained traction almost everywhere. There are some cold spots in the central states, which could be easily explained by the majority of white population living in those states. I am definitely not saying that their failuer to participate in this movement is justified, but is not shocking. It is also visible that these hashtags are being tweeted near the areas that are having protests.

# Datawrapper Graphs

These graphs show how much fuel emessions have risen over the past decades. It follows emssions of solid, liquid, and gass fuels; as well as cement production and gass flaring. It has data going back to 1850's and follows it all the way to 2010's. Solid and liquid fuel are the leaders in emissions and are currently at record highs. Liquid fuel had an exponential curve from 1920-1970 and then has gradually increased over recent years. While solid fuels had a gradual increase over the entire timeline, and spiked in then 2000's.
