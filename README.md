# Ryan McGuiness
Hello! I am Computer Science and Economics major at Lehigh University.
I came into Lehigh as a January admit and have been working hard to graduate with the class of 2021.
	I am Software Developer and love to make clean and easy to follow UI. 
I'm interning at start up company while also doing projects on the side. 
A few of my projects include a personal resume page at [ryanmcguiness.com](https://ryanmcguiness.com). 
I have also created a website that provides book recomendations which could be seen at [booksthatmakeyousmarter.com](https://booksthatmakeyousmarter.com). It is an amazon associated website, so whenever people purchase a book, I recieve a percentage.
